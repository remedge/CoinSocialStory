		h1 About
		p If you're not exactly newbie in the crypto world, you've probably heard community plays the important role in crypto projects, especially when it comes to cryptocurrencies and tokens. In fact, there is no project itself without the community, because then there will be no network load, there will not be a proper amount of miners, and on the exchange these units will no longer be in demand.

		p In order not to estimate the capacity of the project only by its capitalization and the current price, our team are developing the project CoinSocialStory. The main idea is to provide the ability to rank cryptocurrencies and tokens by different social metrics.
